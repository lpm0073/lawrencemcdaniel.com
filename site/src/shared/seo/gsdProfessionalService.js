    "description": "I’m an American full stack developer with significant experience with classic backend stacks and front-end frameworks including Django, React, Angular, and WordPress. I also work extensively with the Open edX® learning management system. I am a veteran of multiple startups and early-stage ventures with dozens of successful product launches in multiple industries and markets around the world. I advocate for open source, try to keep things DRY and well-documented and when possible I adhere to the principals of 12-factor development. I’m a passionate learner and frequent blogger, currently interested in machine learning, AI and quantum computing.",
