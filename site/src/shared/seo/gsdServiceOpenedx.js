I am an expert in configuring the Open edX platform for a variety of common use cases including multi-language and e-commerce enabled platforms of widely varying scale. Open edX® is a mature and stable platform that is also highly configurable. Many customization requests can be implemented via the platform's many configuration parameters. However, configuring the Open edX® platform is a knowledge and experience-intensive endeavor. Properly managing your configuration is also something of a trade craft which you can read more about, here, Open edX Configuration Management Tutorial."
