Technically speaking, each of these options is an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) that AWS internally maintains and makes available to their customers.

Generalizing, this provides 2 cpu’s and 8gb of memory, which is sufficient resource for a small production implementation. As of September 2018 AWS charges $0.0928 per Hour ($67 USD per month) for a t2.large server. You can dramatically reduce the cost of the server by purchasing a one-year contract for the server instance, in which case the cost reduces to $42 USD per month. I launch these with 100gb of drive space, which thus far has been far more than sufficient for my needs. Bear in mind that my recommendation is almost exactly double that provided in the official edX documentation. My view on this is that it’s already challenging enough to get this platform up and running without adding unnecessary challenge by under-sizing your equipment. Very generally speaking, this server config should handle a couple hundred concurrent learners. Look at the bottom of this page for links to downstream repos that are part of a simple horizontal scaling strategy for small (but not tiny) institutions.',
